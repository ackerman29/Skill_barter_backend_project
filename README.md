##  Testing With Postman

1. Signup via `/auth/signup`
2. Login via `/auth/login` and copy JWT
3. Use token with protected routes (add header `Authorization: Bearer <token>`)
4. Test profile, match, and request routes
5. Connect WebSocket and observe real-time messages

##  CORS Setup

For local development with a frontend on `localhost:5173`, CORS is enabled:

```go
import "github.com/gin-contrib/cors"

r.Use(cors.Default())
```
